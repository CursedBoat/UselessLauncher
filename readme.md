# USELESS LAUNCHER

A terminal-based game library manager I'm making because I'm bored and I want to learn more C#.

It's not practical, it's just for fun

## Things it can do
- Save game data
- Launch games

## Planned features
- Searching and pulling game data from stores like Steam and Epic Games
- Filtering and sorting by name, tag etc
- Probably more stuff I can't think of right now

Thanks for reading lmao ok bye
